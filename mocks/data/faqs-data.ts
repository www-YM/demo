          '<p>If you have an online store connected with Inkpodfulfillment and customer orders from your store are imported into Inkpodfulfillment automatically, there are two separate payments that take place: </p><p>The first payment is the retail transaction between your customer and you. Your customer places an order on your storefront and pays you, using your storefrontâ€™s payment platform. </p><p>The second payment is the order fulfillment transaction between you and Inkpodfulfillment. When Inkpodfulfillment gets the order, Inkpodfulfillment charges you for fulfillment and shipping, using Your billing method reserved in Inkpodfulfillment.</p><p>Let&#x27;s put this into context. Say, a customer orders a t-shirt from your store. Their total is $25, shipping included. They will pay you the $25 and you&#x27;ll receive those $25 in the account you&#x27;ve set up on your storefront. Meanwhile, the order is imported into Inkpodfulfillment. The Inkpodfulfillment system detects that it costs $15 to fulfill and ship the order, and gets the funds needed from your billing method reserved in Inkpodfulfillment.</p>',

On the other hand, the shipping price of Inkpodfulfillment is the shipping fee we charge you when we send you your order. This means that the amount you pay is:</p><p><strong>Inkpodfulfillment product price + Inkpodfulfillment shipping price</strong></p><p>And the price your customer pays is:</p><p><strong>Your product retail price + Retail shipping price</strong></p><p>You can choose between retail price and retail shipping price. For example, you can make it equal to the shipping price of Inkpodfulfillment so that your customers will cover the cost, or you can set it to zero to provide free shipping. </p>',
